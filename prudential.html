I built the prototype within the Prudential framework in Sketch and made interactive prototypes in Framer. My work was then selected to be presented to senior leadership.

                            Based on this hierarchy, I noticed the on-boarding questions are a significant barrier to entry for the tools section since users were asked the same questions at the start of each tool. Upon following up with the analytics team, I found that less than 15% of users who enter a tool actually finish all of the on-boarding questions. <br />​<br />I also found that of the 14 questions scattered within different tools, each tool contained 6 on-boarding questions that were necessary to realizing user goals. <br />​<br />What is your age?<br />When do you expect to retire?<br />How many dependents do you have?<br />What are their ages? ​<br />What is your family income?<br />How much do you spend monthly?<br />How much debt do you have?<br /> <br />Thus, instead of waiting for users to find the tools and then fill out additional questions, Prudential could generate suggested goals for both new and existing users based on their responses to these on-boarding questions. With suggested goals, users would not have to scroll through articles and tools to find resources applicable to them. These goals could be immediately presented to users and, if the customer considered one as applicable, they could then fill out additional questions.

                            The paper prototyping process truly helped me work through many usability issues and learn about how users navigated through my prototypes. I was able to conduct multiple usability studies in the Prudential UX research lab and acted as the computer (my colleague Logan, UX Researcher, was the moderator). Through these studies, I found many interesting insights that I applied to future prototypes.

                            From this stage we began to paper prototype different ideations of our solution. Inspired by solutions like Khan Academy, my team and I built a financial education platform that started by conducting a short assessment on users to understand their goals (as mentioned earlier, I reduced the on-boarding assessment to 6 questions from 14). Based on user responses, the platform suggests applicable goals.

                            As financial education was soon to become an integral part of the prototype, it was important to look at how we could further improve this experience. Based on both the design heuristic of flexibility and user feedback, it was clear that the organization of the tools and articles was not clear to most users. In fact, most users did not know where to begin. <br />​<br />The video to the left shows the content of the education feature, which includes both articles and tools. The content is not easily identifiable until a user reads the summary text, and thus most users did not know Prudential offered financial tools.

                                As mentioned in the research section, the current pipeline does not build a relationship with users due to its impersonal nature. Meanwhile, the education portion of the platform is one of the most positively received components of the platform, as it presents users with helpful information without pushing a product or service. However, the educational component is not a primary component of the platform and is thus not utilized by most users.   <br />​<br />Though there are many issues with the current education platform which I will describe later, this tool can be leveraged to build a relationship with Prudential's customers. In addition, Prudential can tailor the products and services offered to a customer based on data gained from the education experience. Overall, adding a modified version of the education experience to the pipeline would increase customer trust and allow Prudential to offer more curated products to its customers.

                                The first step of the design process involved working with the Data Analytics team to analyze how users currently use and view Prudentials financial tools. This was a satisfying process in that I finally used many of the skills I learned in statistics and design research courses in a real-world setting. The current Prudential financial education platform consists of a patchwork of articles and tools. The articles include educational content about users' finances and goals. The tools provide users with insights about their current financial status based on their specific goals (retirement, investments, life-insurance, etc.).  Based on their responses, the tools then offer users specialized services. These tools also help Prudential identify which goals are important to their customers.

                                Prudential offers various financial work place solutions including retirement plans, annuities, and investment accounts. This summer I worked as a UX summer associate in the Prudential Customer Office. This branch of Prudential is fairly new and is tasked with reimagining how Prudential interacts with both its existing and future customers. The design team works in a Pod-based system in which designers are paired with certain projects and initiatives. I worked on a team focused on creating new solutions to increase customer engagement and create trust in Prudential's brand and products.

                            From this stage we began to paper prototype different ideations of our solution. Inspired by solutions like Khan Academy, my team and I built a financial education platform that started by conducting a short assessment on users to understand their goals (as mentioned earlier, I reduced the on-boarding assessment to 6 questions from 14). Based on user responses, the platform suggests applicable goals.

                            Based on this hierarchy, I noticed the on-boarding questions are a significant barrier to entry for the tools section since users were asked the same questions at the start of each tool. Upon following up with the analytics team, I found that less than 15% of users who enter a tool actually finish all of the on-boarding questions. <br />​<br />I also found that of the 14 questions scattered within different tools, each tool contained 6 on-boarding questions that were necessary to realizing user goals. <br />​<br />- What is your age?<br />- When do you expect to retire?<br />- How many dependents do you have?<br />- What are their ages? ​<br />- What is your family income?<br />- How much do you spend monthly?<br />- How much debt do you have?<br /> <br />Thus, instead of waiting for users to find the tools and then fill out additional questions, Prudential could generate suggested goals for both new and existing users based on their responses to these on-boarding questions. With suggested goals, users would not have to scroll through articles and tools to find resources applicable to them. These goals could be immediately presented to users and, if the customer considered one as applicable, they could then fill out additional questions.

                            As financial education was soon to become an integral part of the prototype, it was important to look at how we could further improve this experience. Based on both the design heuristic of flexibility and user feedback, it was clear that the organization of the tools and articles was not clear to most users. In fact, most users did not know where to begin. <br />​<br />The video to the left shows the content of the education feature, which includes both articles and tools. The content is not easily identifiable until a user reads the summary text, and thus most users did not know Prudential offered financial tools.

                            As mentioned in the research section, the current pipeline does not build a relationship with users due to its impersonal nature. Meanwhile, the education portion of the platform is one of the most positively received components of the platform, as it presents users with helpful information without pushing a product or service. However, the educational component is not a primary component of the platform and is thus not utilized by most users.   <br />​<br />Though there are many issues with the current education platform which I will describe later, this tool can be leveraged to build a relationship with Prudential's customers. In addition, Prudential can tailor the products and services offered to a customer based on data gained from the education experience. Overall, adding a modified version of the education experience to the pipeline would increase customer trust and allow Prudential to offer more curated products to its customers.

                            The first step of the design process involved working with the Data Analytics team to analyze how users currently use and view Prudentials financial tools. This was a satisfying process in that I finally used many of the skills I learned in statistics and design research courses in a real-world setting. The current Prudential financial education platform consists of a patchwork of articles and tools. The articles include educational content about users' finances and goals. The tools provide users with insights about their current financial status based on their specific goals (retirement, investments, life-insurance, etc.).  Based on their responses, the tools then offer users specialized services. These tools also help Prudential identify which goals are important to their customers.

                            Prudential offers various financial work place solutions including retirement plans, annuities, and investment accounts. This summer I worked as a UX summer associate in the Prudential Customer Office. This branch of Prudential is fairly new and is tasked with reimagining how Prudential interacts with both its existing and future customers. The design team works in a Pod-based system in which designers are paired with certain projects and initiatives. I worked on a team focused on creating new solutions to increase customer engagement and create trust in Prudential's brand and products.
